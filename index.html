                     Investigating how AI infrastructure expansion interacts with existing 
                     socio-economic inequalities across the U.S. by merging intergenerational 
                     mobility metrics from Raj Chetty's Opportunity Atlas with environmental 
                     datasets on LLM data centers. The work analyzes water consumption, 
                     carbon intensity, and compute infrastructure growth to understand the 
                     tangible footprint of modern AI systems. By bridging computational 
                     research with policy-relevant insights, this project explores how 
                     technology can be built more equitably. Building reproducible, 
                     data-driven pipelines that reveal where AI's expansion overlaps with 
                     regional economic vulnerability.
